# Dojo assignment: Ninja gold

## Logic used to create a game where a ninja can visit 4 different buildings and earn/lose gold pieces:
Used a dictionary rather than if/elif statements to return random number based on location

Inserted activity into the front of the array to display newest first in activity log on web page

Practiced using session to store data for the game
